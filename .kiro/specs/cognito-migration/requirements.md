# Cognito Cross-Account Migration Requirements

## Core Migration Requirements (EARS Notation)

### REQ-001: User Migration Trigger
```
WHEN a user attempts to sign in to Account B user pool with credentials that don't exist locally
THE SYSTEM SHALL invoke a Lambda migration trigger to authenticate against Account A user pool
```

### REQ-002: Password Preservation
```
WHEN the Lambda migration trigger successfully authenticates a user against Account A
THE SYSTEM SHALL create the user in Account B with the same password and set finalUserStatus to CONFIRMED
```

### REQ-003: Cross-Account Authentication
```
WHEN the migration Lambda function receives authentication requests
THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate users against the source Account A user pool using AWS SDK
```

### REQ-004: User Attribute Migration
```
WHEN a user is successfully authenticated during migration
THE SYSTEM SHALL transfer all user attributes (email, phone, custom attributes) from Account A to Account B
```

### REQ-005: Error Handling
```
WHEN authentication fails against Account A during migration
THE SYSTEM SHALL return an authentication error and NOT create a user in Account B
```

### REQ-006: Migration Logging
```
WHEN migration events occur (success or failure)
THE SYSTEM SHALL log detailed information to CloudWatch for monitoring and debugging
```

### REQ-007: Security Compliance
```
WHEN handling user credentials during migration
THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure passwords are never logged or exposed in plain text
```

### REQ-008: Cross-Region Networking
```
WHEN the Lambda function needs to communicate with Account A resources
THE SYSTEM SHALL establish secure cross-account IAM role assumptions and network connectivity
```
