### TASK-010: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test end-to-end migration flow
- [ ] Validate cross-account authentication
- [ ] Test with various user scenarios (different attributes, MFA, etc.)
- [ ] Performance testing for migration latency

### TASK-011: Security Testing
- [ ] Penetration testing of migration flow
- [ ] Validate password security measures

- [ ] Configure staging user pools
- [ ] Test with staging data
- [ ] Validate all functionality

### TASK-016: Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Configure production monitoring
- [ ] Execute deployment checklist
- [ ] Validate production functionality

### TASK-017: Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Monitor migration success rates
- [ ] Validate user experience
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Security validation
